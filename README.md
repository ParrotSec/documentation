# Parrot Project's Documentation Portal

This Project contains the majority of Parrot's documentation for ParrotOS and the Parrot Project. Currently this Repository is not prepared for CI/CD but we hope to change that in the near future. If you wish to contribute please read thoroughly before doing so and thanks for reading!
