For the Parrot Project homepage, visit [parrotsec.org](https://parrotsec.org).

An important part of any operating system is documentation, the technical manuals that describe the operation and use of programs. As part of its efforts to create a high-quality free operating system, the Parrot Project is making every effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation in an easily accessible form.

The documentation is still under construction, and all the Parrot users are invited to contribute to the creation and translation process of this portal.

### Debian Documentation

The Parrot Project is based on top of the testing branch of Debian GNU/Linux, then most of the [Debian Documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc) is valid for Parrot as well.

 * [Debian Handbook](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/), the comprehensive user manual
 * [Debian Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/), a terse user's guide with the focus on the shell command line
 * [The Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/)
