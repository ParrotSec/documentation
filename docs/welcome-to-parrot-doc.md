# ParrotOS Documentation

An important part of any operating system is documentation, the technical manuals which describe the operation and use of programs. As part of its efforts to create a high-quality free operating system, the Parrot Project is making every effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation in an easily accessible form.

The documentation is a continuous Work In Progress (WIP), and all Parrot users are invited to contribute to the creation and translation process of this portal.

At the moment, it is divided into three main areas:

- [Introduction](<./introduction/what-is-parrot>), containing all the basic information on the Parrot project.

- [Installation](<./installation/installation>), where it is shown how to install Parrot on your physical or virtual machine, create a boot device, docker, etc...

- [Configuration](<./configuration/parrot-software-management>), here you will find the more technical aspects, some tips on how to configure some software, management of your system, etc...

This documentation has been possible thanks to Parrot OS community members's work.
