# Warrant Canary

This page is to inform users that the Parrot Project has not been served with a secret government subpoena in its servers (ParrotProject/Frozenbox infrastructure), its software (Parrot OS and its official derivatives), or its services (XMPP chat services, community service, gitlab service, email service, CDN service).

If a warrant canary has not been updated in the time period specified by Parrot Project, or if this page disappears, users are to assume that Parrot Project has indeed been served with a secret subpoena.

The intention is to allow Parrot Project to warn users of the existence of a subpoena passively, without disclosing to others that the government has sought or obtained access to information or records under a secret subpoena.

Warrant canaries have been found to be legal by the United States Justice Department, so long as they are passive in their notifications.
