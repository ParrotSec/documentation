### Parrot Security disk partitioning

We think guided partitioning for less experienced users is recommended, 40 GB or more is enough, unless your going to want to install a lot of programs or keep larger file on your hard drive.

Select the options that you think will be most useful to you and click on *Next*.

### Creating a new user account

You will be asked to create a new user, for simplicity we have chosen a **user**.

Remember that it is the password to access your OS account, we recommend you to create a long and complex one.
