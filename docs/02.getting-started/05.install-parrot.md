## Work In Progress

This documentation is under construction, and our volunteers are working to write an upgraded installation tutorial.

Please contact [Our Support](https://comunity.parrotsec.org) if you need help with the installation process.

Parrot uses the Debian Installer with a simplified configuration to install the system. If you know how the Debian Installer works, then you are already able to install Parrot. For everyone else, our community will provide full support while the new installation tutorial is finished.
