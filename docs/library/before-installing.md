## Backup all your data!
### Seriously! Please back up all data before install. 

The install will wipe it all gone . . well pretty much gone it will require a lot of effort to get back if you can. So please back up your system prior to installing. If you are attempting to multi-boot BACKUP that system as well. accidents happen and you don'want to run the risk of losing everything.

Ensure you have everything ready, a smart phone or spare system to look up how to troubleshoot some odd problem is invaluable and can save you hours.

Ensure you know the limitations of your hardware (don't attempt to install am64 ISO on a 32 bit system)

Learn about your BIOS/UEFI before you start installing. Make all necessary changes before you install.
