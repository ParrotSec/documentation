## Parrot Home

[Parrot Home](https://www.parrotsec.org/download-home.php) is designed for daily use. It's geared toward regular users who need a lightweight, always updated and beautiful system.

The distribution has the same look and feel of a regular Parrot environment and includes all the basic programs for daily work. Parrot Home also includes programs to chat privately, encrypt documents with the highest cryptographic standards or surf the net in a completely anonymous and secure way.

The system can also be used as a starting point to build a very customized pentesting platform with only the bare essentials, or you can use it to build your professional workstation by taking advantage of all the latest and most powerful technologies of Debian without the hassle.

## Netinstall Images

Parrot offers [netinstall images](https://www.parrotsec.org/download-other.php).

Netinstall images are special lightweight iso files containing only the installer.

The installer is configured to partition the disk, establish an internet connection and install the system from scratch by downloading all the packages via internet.

The netinstall image can be used to install only the headless Parrot Core, or it can be used to install different Desktop Environments.

## Docker templates

[Docker](https://www.parrotsec.org/download-other.php) is a powerful containerization technology that allows the user to start multiple instances of a template and use them as isolated environments that can be destroyed and restarted in a matter of seconds.

A full virtual machine usually requires more computer resources (RAM, CPU time and storage), long installation and configuration times and maintenance.

The purpose of Parrot for Docker is to easily offer the whole Parrot toolkit on top of every operating system supported by Docker (*NIX distributions, Mac OS and Windows) without all the negative effects of a full virtualized environment.

You can fire up a Parrot container inside your existing system or using a cloud provider in just few seconds, and by using an extremely limited amount of resources (just the memory required by the individual tools you run).

If you want to perform more tests, each in an isolated environment/workspace, you can start multiple instances from the same Parrot template.
