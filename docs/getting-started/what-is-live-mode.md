## What is live mode

The live mode is a special boot mode offered by many linux distributions, including Parrot OS, which allows the users to load a fully working linux environment without the need to install it.

This is possible because the system is not loaded onto the system's hard drive, instead it is loaded into memory (Random Access Memory).

Parrot OS offers the ability to install the OS while in a live environment, use all the tools and even create a persistent live environment.

To create a live boot device please read this [page](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/getting-started/create-boot-device/).
To learn how to boot from the live media read this [page](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/getting-started/how-to-boot/) instead.

## Default username and password
In Parrot OS live environment the default username is "user" and the default password is "toor".
