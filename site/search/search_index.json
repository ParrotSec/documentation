It includes a full portable arsenal for IT security and digital forensics operations, but it also includes everything you need to develop your own programs or protect your privacy while surfing the net. The operating system ships with the MATE desktop environment preinstalled and is available in several flavors to fit your needs. History and Team The first public release appeared on April 10th, 2013 as the result of the work of Lorenzo Faletra who continues to lead development. Originally developed as part of Frozenbox, the effort has grown to include a community of open source developers, professional security experts, advocates of digital rights, and Linux enthusiasts from all around the globe. The project is headquartered in Palermo, Italy and it is supported by an international team of experts and enthusiasts. Who is it designed for The system is designed to be familiar for the security expert and easy to use for the new entry student, but it does not try to hide its internals as other general purpose distributions try to do. Parrot can be used as a daily system , and it provides all the programs for the day to day tasks, including dedicated system flavors that don't ship security tools. Secure Sandboxed Environment People familiar with other pentest distributions may notice that Parrot is quite unique, as it does not allow direct root logins for safety reasons (root can only be used with sudo), and it provides its own sandbox system by combining Firejail and AppArmor with custom security profiles. Software Store The system has its own applications repository including all the packages supported by Debian (more than 56000 packages available over 4 different architectures), plus many other applications and tools Debian can't provide yet, all of them are accessible directly from the APT package manager. Additionally, Parrot supports SNAP , a new package distribution system that provides easy access to many other programs that GNU/Linux distributions don't always ship in their software archives. Take a look at the snap programs list . Flatpak is an universal software store similar to snap. It can be installed from the Parrot official repository. Parrot supports Wine, a compatibility layer to run Windows applications in Linux environments.","title":"What is Parrot?"},{"location":"01.Introduction/01.what-is-parrot/#the-parrot-system","text":"Parrot (Parrot Security, ParrotOS, Parrot GNU/Linux) is a free and open source GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian Testing designed for security experts, developers and privacy aware people.

First of all, even if Parrot provides general purpose flavors, its core is still tuned for Security and Forensics operations. In this section we will explain how different is Parrot compared to other general purpose distributions and how different it is from other Pentest and Forensics distributions. Then we will present some categories of people and what kind of experience they may have by using this system. General purpose distributions Parrot is different from a general purpose distribution (i.e. Ubuntu) because it does not try in any way to hide its internals. Meaning that many automation tools included in the system to make it easier to use, still expose what the system has under the hood. A good example is the parrot update reminder : it is a simple yet powerful program that prompts the user to check for system upgrades once a week. but instead of hiding the upgrade process behind a progress bar, it shows the user the full upgrade process from the apt output. Another important difference is that Parrot disables by default all the network services pre-installed in the system, not only to maintain a very low RAM footprint and offer better performance, but also to avoid services exposure in a target network. Every network service needs to be manually started when the user needs it. Pentest distributions Pentest distributions are famous to integrate only security tools, allow easy root access and take down all the system security barriers that may influence the workflow of a pentester. Parrot was designed to be a very comfortable environment for security experts and researchers, and it also includes all the basic programs for daily use that pentest distribution usually exclude (at the cost of less than an additional gigabyte of storage). This choice was taken to make Parrot not only a good system where to perform security tests, but also a good environment where to write reports and communicate with teammates without any need of additional computers, operating systems or installation/configuration steps. Our goal is to allow any professional pentester to make a whole security test from the beginning to the report with just a Parrot ISO and an average laptop. Secure distributions Parrot includes its own sandbox system obtained with the combination of Firejail and AppArmor with custom security profiles. User applications in Parrot are protected and \"jailed\" to limit the damages in case the system is compromised. All this additional security comes with a cost: it is harder to adopt bad behaviors on Parrot. For instance it is not possible to log in as root with the whole desktop environment, or to start critical applications like browsers, media players or advanced document readers with unnecessary privileged permissions. The user can still open root consoles, launch security tools with privileged permissions and use the system without limits. The only thing that changes is that all the critical user applications are now protected from very bad behaviors and common exploit techniques, and the damages caused by advanced exploits are very limited. Forensics distributions Digital forensics experts need and environment that does not compromise their proof. Parrot comes with automount functions disabled by default , to allow forensics acquisitions to be performed in a safe way. The global automount policy is configured in a redundant way in all the layers of the system stack, from the noautomount kernel option passed by default at boot, to the specific file manager settings to disable auto mount and plug&play features. Don't forget that the disks are still recognized by the system, and the system will mount them without protections if the user accidentally open them. The no-automount behavior is consistent and stable, but no protection is provided in case of accidental mounts. a write blocker is always recommended in any digital forensics scenario.

Parrot Home Parrot Home is a special edition of Parrot designed for daily use, and it targets regular users who need a lightweight, always updated and beautiful system on their laptops or workstations. The distribution has the same look and feel of a regular Parrot environment and includes all the basic programs for daily work. Parrot Home also includes programs to chat privately, encrypt documents with the highest cryptographic standards or surf the net in a completely anonymous and secure way. The system can also be used as a starting point to build a very customized pentesting platform with only the bare needed tools, or you can use it to build your professional workstation by taking advantage of all the latest and most powerful technologies of Debian without hassle. Netinstall Images Parrot offers netinstall images. Netinstall imges are special lightweight iso files containing only the installer. The installer is configured to partition the disk, establish an internet connection and install the system from scratch by downloading all the packages via internet. The netinstall image can be used to install only the headless Parrot Core, or it can be used to install different Desktop Environments. Docker templates Docker is a powerful containerization technology that allows the user to start multiple instances of a template and use them as isolated environments that can be destroyed and restarted in a matter of seconds. A full virtual machine usually requires more computer resources (ram, cpu time and storage), long installation and configuration times and maintenance. The purpose of Parrot for Docker is to easily offer the whole Parrot toolkit on top of every operating system supported by Docker (*NIX distributions, Mac OS and Windows) without all the negative effects of a full virtualized environment. You can fire up a Parrot container inside your existing system or using a cloud provider in just few seconds, and by using an extremely limited amount of resources (just the memory required by the individual tools you run).

You can use a special software like Etcher to clone the content of the Parrot ISO to a USB drive and transform such USB drive into a full Parrot USB device. How NOT to create a Parrot USB drive The Parrot ISO uses the iso9660 format (also known as isohybrid). It is a special ISO format that contains not only the partition content, but also the partition table. Some ISO writing programs do not write the iso bit-per-bit into the usb drive at a low level. They create a custom partition table and just copy the file in the USB drive in an unofficial and non-standard way. This behavior is against what the isohybrid was created for, and may break core system functionalities and make the system uninstallable from such USB drives. Parrot users have NOT to use programs like unetbootin , or any program not isohybrid compliant.
