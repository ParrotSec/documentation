# Parrot's Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open environment, we as Parrot Team members and contributors pledge to make participation in all Parrot Project activities a harassment-free experience for all humans (Cough . . Alexa, Cortana . . privacy-invasive corporate AI shills).

## Our Standards

* Sign and adhere to the Parrot Project's [values](LINK VALUES).
**Defining Parrot Project values:**


### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
We have a global group of people, your perspective is not the only one. Even if you know you're right. Let them finish and present your logical arguement on why you believe they're wrong.
* Giving proper constructive criticism
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the Project and the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Basing ideas, recommendations or solutions on facts and not on feelings.
* Having a growth mindset and helping others keep a growth mindset too.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission (If it's not documented, you don't have permission).
* Discussion of illegal activities.
* Victim blaming/shaming, false accusations, or defaming someone.
* Use of the trope "In my experience as a . .". Unless the next word or words pertain to job positions of a technical nature (sysadmin, software engineer, etc).



## Our Responsibilities

Parrot Project's board of directors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Parrot Project's board of directors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to The values of the Parrot Project and this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Any action taken by the board of directors will have an opportunity to hear everyone's versions of events and allow for a rebuttal to be received and actions reconsidered. Any decision after this is final.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the Parrot Project
is further defined and clarified by Parrot's directors, the Community Team Leader and Parrot's Social Engagement Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the board of directors at directors@parrotsec.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The board of directors is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Parrot Team members, leaders, directors and contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Parrot Project's board of directors.
