# Technical Guidelines for contributors

Thank you for wishing to contribute to the Parrot Project.

Before you begin please read through the requirements below, the [licenses](https://nest.parrotsec.org/parrot-organization/community/blob/master/DCO_licenses.md) and the readme of the repo.

Parrot's workflow is as follows:

You fork the repository you want to contribute to. > You make your changes and GPG-sign your commits. > You push your commits to your fork and open a merge request to the repo you forked. > A Developer will look at your changes and either accept and merge your changes (locally or on the web with gitlab) or reject them with a comment in the closed merge as to why they rejected your merge request. > If your merge request is accepted, congratulations you've contributed to the Parrot Project, you're awesome and someone somewhere loves you. > Go have a coffee enjoy life or get back on and write more patches. :)
