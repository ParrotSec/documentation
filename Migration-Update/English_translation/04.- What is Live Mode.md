## What is live mode ##

The **live mode** is a special boot mode offered by many linux distributions, including Parrot OS, which allows the users
to load a fully working linux environment without the need to install it.

This is possible because the system is not loaded onto the system's hard drive, instead it is loaded into memory.

Parrot OS offers the ability to install the OS while in the live environment, use all of its tools and even create a **persistent live environment**.
