===== What is AnonSurf? =====

     ***  Anonsurf [1] is Parrot's anonymous mode to force connections through tor and/or the i2p network. Anonsurf's usage has a graphical interface, and a 
CommandLine Interface (CLI). **

===== What is Tor? =====
     *** Tor [2] is a SOCKS4 [3] & SOCKS5 encryption protocol.** 
     *** Tor tunnels all traffic running across the users network anonymously.** 
     *** Tor conceals a user's location and network data from anyone monitoring the user locally, and remotely.** 

===== Tor Has Several Use Cases =====
      ***Used with on the browser (torbrowser & iceweasel)**  
      ***IRC [4] clients (hexchat)**
      ***Instant messanging (torchat [5], tormessanger**
      ***Hidden servers (Creating .onion sites)**

===== Tor Technical Details =====
      ***The Tor protocol works by: 
       Multiplexing [6] multiple “circuits” over a single node-to-node TLS connection.**
   ***Tor traffic is routed through 3 nodes by default: Guard, relay, and exit.**

**To be able to route multiple relays, Tor has something called stream multiplexing capability: 
[+] multiple TCP connections can be carried over a single Tor circuit. 
[+] Each node knows only the source and destination pairing for a circuit. It does not know the whole path.
