An important part of any operating system is documentation, the technical manuals that describe the operation and use of programs. As part of its efforts to create a high-quality free operating system, the Parrot Project is making every effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation in an easily accessible form.

The documentation is still being written, and all the Parrot users are invited to contribute to the creation and translation process of this portal.
