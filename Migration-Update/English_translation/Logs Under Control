Logs under control

First log in to your Parrot Security
In my case I'm using version 3.9 Intruter in VPS and 3.8 JollyRoger on Android with Linux Deploy
In this opportunity we will review how to access the logs to understand a problem when it is presented; and if so, the solution is to read clearly and understand the error message that is being generated.
By default, most of the log files are located in

	/var/log
	
In general, it is common for programs to have an internal log. By convention, these are located in

	/var/log/program-name
	
This, that seems a triviality, is extremely important since it allows to centralize the log files. The most important log is probably the found in

	var/log/messages
	
Additionally, there are programs that manage their own logging interval. One of the most interesting is the bash shell.
By default, the bash saves a historical file of the commands executed in

	user/.bash_history
	
The operating system uses LogCheck to perform the analysis
We go with postgresql

	1. cd /var/log/postgresql
	2. ls
In my case I have these 3 files:

 	postgresql-10-main.log postgresql-9.6-main.log postgresql-9.6-main.log.1
	
If we want to see the content of one of them we use this command'cat'
Example:

	3. cat postgresql-10-main.log
	
Now we go with Nginx

	cd /var/log/nginx
	
We can use ls -lart to see dates of the content and what type it is if it is a folder or file
In my case I have these logs

	┌─ [root @ parrot] ─ [/var/log/nginx]
	Ls #ls -lart
	total 28
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 289 Oct 17 06:15 access.log.3.gz
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 943 Oct 17 22:15 access.log.2.gz
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 78 Oct 18 18:28 error.log.1
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 1816 Oct 18 22:11 access.log.1
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 0 Oct 19 06:25 error.log
	drwxr-xr-x 2 root adm 4096 Oct 19 06:25.
	drwxr-xr-x 21 root root 4096 Oct 19 06:25 ..
	-rw-r ----- 1 www-data adm 1584 Oct 19 13:42 access.log
	
In this case, let's see what errors Nginx has with the following command:

	cat error.log
	
In the case of Apache
The access log file records incoming requests and all requests processed by Apache. Such as requests for obtaining and publishing HTTP. These records can be analyzed by log analyzers such as awstats or webalizer. This is configurable by the CustomLog directive.

	cat /var/log/apache2/access.log
	
All Apache errors and diagnostic information found while processing requests are stored here. The location of the error.log file is established by the ErrorLog Directive.

	cat /var/log/apache2/error.log
	
Now let's be more practical, let's see if mysql directly has an error. To do this, type:

	cat /var/log/mysql/error.log
	
System log

	cat /var/log/syslog
	
Contains global system messages, including messages logged during startup. Several things are recorded in this file, including mail, cron, daemon, kern, auth, etc.

	cat /var/log/messages
	
kern.log contains the log of kernel initialization at system startup, as well as any kernel errors or informational messages that are sent from the kernel

  cat /var/log/kern.log
  
Shows recent login information. This is a command that is executed to see the information provided.
How to use the "last" command
Generally, you will only be interested in the most recent login attempts. You can see them with the tool "last":

	last
	cat /var/log/lastlog
	
How to use the "lastlog" command
If you want to see this situation from a different angle, you can see the last time each user logged on to the system.
This information is provided by accessing the file "/ etc / log / lastlog".
Then it is classified according to the entries in the file "/ etc / passwd":

	lastlog
	
The debug log provides detailed system debugging messages and applications that log on to the DEBUG level.

	cat /var/log/debug
	
It is a program that runs in the background of your operating system, which guarantees a better functioning of it. The Daemon record is executed and displayed information about the running system and application daemons. This application allows you to detect and solve problems before they occur.

	cat /var/logdaemon.log
	
How to monitor system logons
A fundamental component of authentication management is system monitoring once you have configured your users.
Fortunately, modern Linux systems record all authentication attempts in a discrete file. This is found in "/var/log/auth.log":

	cat /var/log/auth.log
	
When you run update alternatives, the resulting messages are entered into this log file. In general, it will be empty if you have not run the update-alternatives command.
alternatives creates, deletes, maintains and displays information about the symbolic links that make up the system.

	cat /var/log/alternatives.log
	
How to check what updates were recently applied in detail

	cat var/log/apt/history.log
	
Fontconfig is a library of free software programs designed to provide configuration, enumeration and substitution of sources to other programs.

	cat var/log/fontconfig.log
	
Utility to manipulate the MAC address of the network interfaces

	cat /var/log/macchanger.log
	
Let's review the part of Graphics X11 freedesktop / DisplayManager / Session0

	cat /var/log/var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log
	cat /var/log/var/log/lightdm/seat0-greeter.log
	cat /var/log/var/log/lightdm/x-0.log
	
Let's see the details of the operating system

	cat /var/log/installer/lsb-release
	
Let's understand how storage is partitioned

	cat /var/log/installer/partman
	
Check which packages you have installed

	cat/var/log/installer/status
	
Check the logs since your machine boots

	cat /var/log/installer/syslog
	
Let's identify what type of machine our Parrot is supporting

	cat /var/log/installer/hardware-summary
