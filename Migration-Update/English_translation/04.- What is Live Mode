==== What is live mode ====

The **live mode** is a special boot mode offered by many linux distributions, including Parrot OS, which allows the users
to load a fully working linux environment without the need to install it.

This is possible because the system is not loaded onto the system's hard drive, instead it is loaded into memory.

Parrot OS offers the ability to install the OS while in the live environment, use all of its tools and even create a [[Parrot USB Live Persistence | persistent live environment]].

To create a live boot device please read [[How to create a live boot device] | this ]] page.\\
To learn how to boot from the live media read [[How to boot | this]] page instead.
