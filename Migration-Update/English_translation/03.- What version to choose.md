====== What version to choose ======


Parrot comes in a lot of shapes and sizes in order to fit in all the possible hardware and users needs.

Depending on what hardware configuration and scope you have, consider these options:

As the name suggests, this is the full edition.
After the installation you have a complete out of the box pentesting workstation loaded with a big variety of tools ready to use.
Highly reccomended for Desktops and Laptops with at least 4GB of RAM, in order to have a smooth experience while multitasking.

==== Parrot 3.x Lite Edition (x86 and x86_64) :====
This version of Parrot is aimed for a lightweight installation which provides the essential tools to start working.
It relays on the same repositories as the Full Edition, letting you choose most of the programs you want to install later on.

==== Parrot 3.x Cloud Edition (x86 and x86_64) :====
