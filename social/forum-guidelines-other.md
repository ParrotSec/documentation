From Debian Forum

Let me first welcome you to the Debian Users Forum. We hope your visit here will both help and enlighten you in your Debian experience.

We do have a few expectations of what you have done already to find your answer.
1) We expect that you have used Google or another search engine to find your answer.
2) That you have searched the Man pages available on your topic.
If you don't know how you may do this, open a terminal and at the prompt enter "man topic" where "topic" represents the topic you are having trouble with.
3) Lastly, that you have tried to use the forum search feature to find help on your issue.

Here is a few links that may help you in your search for answers:

Debian Wiki: http://wiki.debian.org/FrontPage
Debian Reference: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/
Debian FAQ: http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/

We are glad to be here to help you, you should however realize that our members and staff are ALL volunteer people just like you. No one gets paid to be here and help. Also our members are from all over the globe and there may be dead times on the forum where no one responds right away. We do try to avoid this though.

Thank you for your interest in Debian, I hope you find it as much of a rewarding experience as I do.

Debian Forum Guidelines

Before you start using Debian User Forums, please observe the following guidelines:

    Do not cross post. Posting the same topic in more than one category only creates confusion and makes it hard to keep track on the various replies. Double posts will be locked.
    Be descriptive. Use a meaningful headline and try to make your question as clear as possible. Include as much information as possible such as what Debian branch you are using, error messages, what you did that may have caused the problem etc. This greatly increase the chances of getting useful help.
    Be patient. Not everyone knows everything and not everyone is online all the time. If you don't get a reply chances are that no one is online that knows the answer at the moment. Do not 'bump' your questions just because there have been a few hours with no reply.
    Do not post a reply to obvious SPAM. If the forums are getting severely spammed and no moderators are online please use the spam reporting thread or send an e-mail to team@forums.debian.net
    Be polite. Remember that the skill level of the forum members ranges from the absolute beginner to the very seasoned Linux user and what might be obvious to you might be very hard to understand for others. It's OK to point someone to other resources or suggest means of learning but do so politely; 'RTFM' has no place on this board.
    Do not engage in flame wars. Threads that evolve into flaming will be locked. If you feel attacked; be the better person and ignore it. The moderators are not omnipresent, so if you feel some actions need to be taken please e-mail the moderator team on team@forums.debian.net
    Stay on topic. Sometimes threads morph into something completely off topic, this is unavoidable when a bunch of people communicate. However, try to limit the off topic discussions to the off topic category. Long off topic discussions in other categories might get moved or locked.
    Discussions in "Off topic" should still be in the spirit of this board, that is related to Linux/ Computers/ Software etc. Political, religious or racial discussions do not belong on this board.
    Avoid 'thread hijacking'. Unless your question is directly related to the thread's topic, start a new one.
    As a rule we do not accept commercial content. If you'd like to offer your Debian related services for money or you are offering a paid job please e-mail team@forums.debian.net first and it will be considered on a case by case basis.
    The language on this board is primarily English but we do not exclude people with little or no English. When replying to posts in other languages please include an English translation. It's a good idea to help non-English speakers find resources in their language.
    A forum is a means of written communication so make sure your posts are as readable as possible. That means: Use capital letters and punctuation, and use the formatting features of the forum wisely in order to make your post attractive. Try to avoid 'l33t speak', 'chatspeak,' and 'SMS language'.
    There is no need to apologize for poor English skills. We have users from all over the world and trying your best is more than adequate.
    Moderators might move your thread to a more suitable category (for instance from 'General Discussion' to 'General Questions'). This is no cause for alarm and a shadow topic, linked directly to the new location, will always be left at the original location.
    If you feel like your post/ thread has been locked, edited or even removed in error please contact the moderator team via e-mail at team@forums.debian.net.
