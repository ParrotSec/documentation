Guys, please check it out and let me know your thoughts. Changes have been made to better align with our values and to add the docs page. Also I started using our forum stuff then saw DTF had a much better list and reacquired it.

When using Parrot's chat services, please observe the following guidelines:

General Rules:
~ English, Only

For Asking Help:
~ Read and search https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/ before you ask. 
~ Google first, seriously!
~ Don't ask to ask. Just ask.
~ After you ask a question be patient

* Ban

To Appeal a ban or action send a PM to @reporting on the forum, detailing what happened and why you think it was wrong. The moderator will have a chance to give his side of the story and a decision will be made shortly after. All decisions are final.
