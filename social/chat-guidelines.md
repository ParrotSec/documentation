Guys, please check it out and let me know your thoughts. Changes have been made to better align with our values and to add the docs page. Also I started using our forum stuff then saw DTF had a much better list and reacquired it.

When using Parrot's chat services, please observe the following guidelines:

General Rules:
~ English, Only
* No Spam
* No advertising
* No NSFW
~ No piracy
~ Be respectful and do not insult each other.
~ Don't forward from other channels
~ Ask admins before you send private messages

For Asking Help:
~ Read and search https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/ before you ask. 
~ Google first, seriously!
~ Don't ask to ask. Just ask.
~ After you ask a question be patient
~ Do your own research! 
~ Format snippets of code with single or triple grave symbols "`"
~ Don't take photo of code
~ Don't paste long code. Use one of these:
- hastebin.com

(we need some form of appeals process)
