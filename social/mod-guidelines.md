## For our moderators

### Moderator/Admin guidelines

1. Please, don't be a dick. For every action you take (deleting, locking, delisting etc.) PM or add a post on why you took that action. Every action you take reflects on the Parrot Linux Team and our values. 

2. Have patience. Do not let people goad you into fights. if someone is sending you weird PMs trying to get you to engage, just don't. Remember you wear big boy pants for a reason, don't ever stoop to their games. 

3. Follow the our guidelines. It looks terrible from any perspective if you say do as I say, not as I do. Be a leader, if you don't want the rules, have a vote to change them for all.

## Forum specific

4. De-list threads for those who do not fill out the form or provide sufficient detail. It is a waste of everyone’s time involved and although we may upset some people in the short term it will help educate people that this “help vampire” behavior isn’t acceptable but, learning is.

5. Our resources are better spent helping those who wish to educate themselves, e.g. the guys who provide logs and have tried to figure out the problem but are stuck somewhere along the line. If we spread ourselves thin by babying those who aren’t putting effort in we are simply encouraging “this gimme me answers now,” which waste our time while people who would benefit from our help don’t receive it.

6. For those who want immediate gimme answers give them the tools to learn e.g. “please research this topic, please check our troubleshooting docs” and so forth. Not providing the direct answer but a chance for them to exercise their skills for research and problem solving; which I believe we can all agree are extremely important in this field.

7. Move topics as needed. change titles as appropriate. Guide people to find their answer don't let them suck other people into feeding them their research. If they're opening 10 topics and most of the topics show a clear lack of reading the docs, PM the user on why you're silencing them (two weeks is long enough) and what you want to see in the future (more searching less posting obviously).

8. Don't post the exact answer, lead them to it every time. if it's in the docs post the general docs url.
