======Compile a custom kernel "the Debian way" ======

==== Install build dependencies ====
To work with the linux debianized kernel, you need to have some development packages, install them with the following command

''sudo apt build-dep linux''


====Download the kernel source code====
You can get the source code of the parrot kernel from different places


===APT INSTALL===

run ''sudo apt update'' to refresh the sources list

launch ''sudo apt install linux-source'' to download the kernel source code in ''/usr/src''


===APT SOURCE===

edit ''/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list'' and make sure that the deb-src directive is not commented (remove the ''#'' character if present)

run ''sudo apt update'' to refresh the sources list

launch ''apt source linux'' to download the source code of the linux kernel from our repository

===GIT===

make sure you have git installed with ''sudo apt install git''

launch ''git clone https://github.com/parrotsec/linux-parrot.git'' to download the parrot kernel source in the current folder


====Configure the source code====

Open a terminal window and enter the kernel source, then run

''make menuconfig''

This command will open the kernel configuration editor where you can take a look at the modules available, select or deselect them, decide if to include them as hard-coded in the base image or as a dynamically loadable module, and you can change the settings of most of them.

===Install hardware-info===
By running
''sudo apt install hwinfo''
so that you can safely remove support for hardware you're not going to use on your machine.
This will make your kernel lighter and faster.

Once it is done you can save the configuration and proceed with the next step.

====Compile the deb packages====

Compile the kernel with the following commands

<code>
make clean
make deb-pkg
</code>

====Install the new kernel packages====

Once it's done, install the resulting packages with the following command

<code>
sudo dpkg -i ../linux-{image,headers}-*.deb
</code>
