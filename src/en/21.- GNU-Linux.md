# Free Software

"Free software" is software that respects the freedom of users and their community. Broadly speaking, it means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, modify, and improve the software. In other words, "free software" is a question of freedom, not price. To understand the concept, think of "free" as "free speech", not "free beer." In English, sometimes in the place of "free software" we say "libre software", using that spanish adjective, derived from "freedom", to show that we do not mean that the software is free.

Four are the freedoms that define "Free Software":
- **Freedom 0** : The freedom to run the program as desired, for any purpose.
- **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to do what you want. Access to the source code is a necessary condition for this.
- **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies.
- **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute copies of its modified versions to third parties. This allows you to offer the entire community the opportunity to benefit from the modifications. Access to the source code is a necessary condition for this.

A program is "free software" if it appropriately grants users all of these freedoms. Otherwise it is not free. It is said to be "Proprietary Software" or "Proprietary Software".

By way of summary we could say that:
- "Free Software" or "Libre Software" does not necessarily mean that it is free, although in many cases it is.
- "Free Software" provides four basic freedoms: freedom to run software, freedom to modify and study your code, freedom to redistribute copies of such software, and freedom to distribute copies of modified software.
