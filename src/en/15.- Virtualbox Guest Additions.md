===== Introduction To Virtualbox Guest Additions ======
The Guest Additions are designed to be installed inside a virtual machine after the guest operating system has been installed. \\
They consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability.

===== Features Of Virtualbox Guest Additions =====
  * **Mouse pointer integration**
    * Pressing the Host key is no longer required to "free" the mouse from being captured by the guest OS.
  * **Shared folders**
    * Shared folders between Host and Parrot.
  * **Better video support**
    * While the virtual graphics card which VirtualBox emulates for any guest operating system provides all the basic features, the custom video drivers that are installed with the Guest Additions provide you with extra high and non-standard video modes as well as accelerated video performance. \\ __(Generally used for changing monitor resolution)__
  * **Seamless windows**
    * With this feature, the individual windows that are displayed on the desktop of the virtual machine can be mapped on the host's desktop, as if the underlying application was actually running on the host.
  * **Generic host/guest communication channels**
    * The Guest Additions enable you to control and monitor guest execution in ways other than those mentioned above. The so-called "guest properties" provide a generic string-based mechanism to exchange data bits between a guest and a host, some of which have special meanings for controlling and monitoring the guest.
  * **Time synchronization**
    * Synchronize date and time from host to Parrot.
  * **Shared clipboard**
    * Shared clipboard from host to Parrot.
