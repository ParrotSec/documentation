###  Parrot Security disk partitioning ###

As this is all Virtualized, you can choose anything you want to.
\

I personally think guided partitioning for less experienced users is recommended, 40 GB or more are enough, unless your going to want to install alot more programs or keep larger file on your hard drive.
