## How to create a Bootable Device ##

First of all, you need to download the latest ISO file from our [website](https://parrotsec.org/download/).

Then you can burn it using [Balena Etcher](https:https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [ROSA ImageWriter](http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter). They both work on GNU/Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

You need a USB drive of at least 8 GB for Security Edition and 4 GB for Home Edition.


### Parrot USB installation procedure using Balena Etcher ###

Plug your USB stick into your USB port and launch **Balena Etcher**. Download and unzip it.
