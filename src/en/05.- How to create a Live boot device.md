## How to create a Bootable Device ##

First of all you need to download the latest ISO file from our [website](https://parrotlinux.org/download/).

Then you can burn it using [Balena Etcher](https:https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [ROSA ImageWriter](http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter).

You need a USB drive of at least 4GB for Security Edition or 2GB for Home Edition.



## Parrot ISO installation Procedure ##


Plug your USB stick into your USB port and launch [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Select the Parrot ISO file and verify that the USB drive you are going to overwrite is the right one.
