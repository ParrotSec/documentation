<h1 align="center">Welcome to our Documentation</h1>

An important part of any operating system is documentation, the technical manuals which describe the operation and use of programs. As part of its efforts to create a high-quality free operating system, the Parrot Project is making every effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation in an easily accessible form.

The documentation is a continuous Work In Progress (WIP), and all Parrot users are invited to contribute to the creation and translation process of this portal.

At the moment, it is divided into three main areas:

- [Introduction](<./01.- What is Parrot.md>), containing all the basic information on the Parrot project

- [Installation](<./03.- Installation.md>), where it is shown how to install Parrot on your physical or virtual machine, create a boot device, docker, etc...

- [Configuration](<./23.- Parrot Software Management.md>), here you will find the more technical aspects, some tips on how to configure some software, management of your system, etc...

## Why Parrot? ##

**Because it was born as a game, and every pirate of the seven seas needs a parrot on his shoulders if he wants to board the galleons with his crew of jailbird filibusters**.
