**How to Dual Boot Parrot Security And Windows**


Parrot Security is often best installed in a dual-boot system. This allows you to run Linux on your actual hardware, but you can always reboot into Windows if you need to run Windows software or play PC games.

Setting up Parrot Security on a dual-boot system is fairly simple, and the principles are the same for every Linux distribution. Dual-booting Linux on a Mac or a Chromebook is a different process.



**The Basics**

Here’s the basic process you’ll need to follow:


**Install Windows First**

Your PC probably already has Windows installed on it. If you’re setting up a PC from scratch, be sure to select the “Custom install” option and tell Windows to use only part of the hard drive, leaving some allocated space left over for Parrot Security. This will save you the trouble of resizing the partition later.
If you already have windows installed, then follow the next of instructions.

**Windows Already Installed**: If you already have Windows installed, that’s fine. If not, be sure to install Windows first, before you install Parrot Security system. If you install Parrot Security second, it can set up its boot loader properly to happily co-exist with Windows. if you install Windows second, it will ignore Parrot Security, and you’ll have to go through some trouble to get your Parrot Security GRUB boot loader working again.




Choose your Parrot Security distribution and put its installer on a USB drive or DVD. Boot from that drive and install it on your system, making sure you select the option that installs it on the hard drive we are going to create in windows. 
Don’t tell it to wipe your hard drive. It’ll automatically set up a GRUB boot loader menu that lets you choose your preferred operating system each time you boot your computer.
Although the broad outlines are simple, this can be complicated by a number of issues including UEFI Secure Boot requirements on Windows 8 & 10 PCs and disk encryption.



**Partition For Parrot Security**:
You will probably want to resize your Windows system partition to make room for Parrot Security. If you already have some unallocated space or a separate hard drive for Parrot Security, that’s perfect. Otherwise, it’s time to resize that existing Windows partition so you can make space for a new Parrot Security partition.


You can do this in several ways. Most Linux installers allow you to resize Windows NTFS partitions, so you can do this during the installation process. However, you may just want to shrink your Windows system partition from within Windows itself to avoid any potential problems.



To do so, open the Disk Management utility — press Windows Key + R, type diskmgmt.msc into the Run dialog, and press Enter. Right-click the Windows system partition — that’s likely your C:\ drive — and select “Shrink Volume.” Shrink it to free up space for your new Parrot Security system.

If you’re using BitLocker encryption on Windows, you won’t be able to resize the partition. Instead, you’ll need to open the Control Panel, access the BitLocker settings page, and click the “Suspend protection” link to the right of the encrypted partition you want to resize. 
You can then resize it normally, and BitLocker will be re-enabled on the partition after you reboot your computer.




**Create Bootable USB/DVD:**

Next, make installation media for your Parrot Security system. You can download the ISO file from[[https://www.parrotsec.org/download.fx]] and burn it to a disk or create a bootable USB drive. Reboot your computer and it should automatically boot from the installation media you’ve inserted. If not, you’ll need to change its boot order or use the UEFI boot menu to boot from a device.

On some newer PCs, your PC may refuse to boot from the Linux installation media because Secure Boot is enabled. Many Linux distributions will now boot normally on Secure Boot systems, but not all of them. You may need to disable Secure Boot before installing Parrot Security.

Go through the installer until you reach an option that asks where (or how) you want to install the Parrot Security distribution. This will look different, but you want to choose the option that lets you install Parrot Security on the separate partition you created on Windows (usually labeled free space) or choose a manual partitioning option and create your own partitions. 
Don’t tell the installer to take over an entire hard drive or replace Windows, as that’ll wipe away your existing Windows system. So 
make sure you partition on the free space or assigned drive you created.



Once you’ve installed Parrot Security, it will install the GRUB boot loader to your system. Whenever you boot your computer, GRUB will load first, allowing you to choose which operating system you want to boot — Windows or Parrot Security.

You can customize Grub’s options, including which operating system is the default and how long GRUB waits until it automatically boots that default operating system. Most Linux distributions don’t offer easy GRUB configuration applications, so you may need to configure the GRUB boot loader by editing its configuration files.
But as a normal Parrot Security's GRUB does respond well if installed correctly and there is not any problems.
