## Parrot Linux Objectives

- The construction of a robust and reliable build infrastructure, where our already highly advanced pipelines can run in heavily secured environments.
- The expanse of our OS in public and private sectors, especially in Italy, where we are located. [public administrations, schools, non-profits, etc…]
- The formalization of the actual FrozenBox non-profit here in Italy, to lay the legal groundwork required to set our near-future donations program in motion, and federate with other projects in the area.
- The search for our very own future datacenter and peering agreements with other network operators, to bring our online presence and its bandwith to a whole new level.
- To develop a rock-solid LTS edition for better stability and reliability.
- To make the parrot environment portable to other distributions and environments.

### To kickstart this process, we’ve outlined three simple and extremely effective actions you can take right now to shape the future of our work: 

- Become a regular contributor on patreon.com/parrot
- Become a parrot developer (debian package maintainer skills are required)
- Help us hosting our infrastructure by sending us servers or housing our currently spare nodes.
