img files need to be linked with double periods or they link improperly on the
server. For example:

[parrot](/img/parrot.svg) will show as https://www.parrotsec.org/img/parrot.svg

To use the correct file path,use:
[parrot](../img/parrot.svg) 

NOTE: For Parrot docs all images should be kept in docs/img/ path

to download Images off a site (e.g. several)

wget -r -P /download/location -A jpg,jpeg,gif,png http://www.site.here
